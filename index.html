        <h3>Calculators</h3>
        <p>In 1942, something happened that would radically shape the way computers were developed. The first electromagnetic calculator, called the ABC (Atanasoff-Berry-Calculator) was created. The ABC could do complex calculations with ease. Even IBM (International
            Business Machines Corp.) was getting in on the scene. In particular, Howard Aiken was one of the leading people behind calculators during this decade. Fred Williams was another key player in the development of calculators in the 40s. He specialized
            in better storage methods, such as the vacuum tube design seen in many computers in the later years of the decade. A few inventions were , the first programmed-controlled computer in 1941, the transistor in 1947, and the first high-level programming
            language in 1948.

        <h3>The ENIAC</h3>
        <p>But calculators were not the only innovation of the times; far from it. In 1943, the U.S. military needed a better way to calculate missile trajectories. The solution was the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). At their current
            rate, women with calculators could calculate a sixty-second trajectory in about 20 hours, but the ENIAC could do this same task in about 30 seconds. Codenamed Project PX, it was programmed by a large team of women, led by Jean Jennings, Marlyn
            Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman, Betty Snyder, Frances Bilas, and Kay McNulty. These women were integral to the success of the entire project. But the real stars of the show were John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. They were the brains behind the
            operation, and eventually ended up forming their own company just to get the patent rights to the computer, which used decimal (base 10) as opposed to binary (base 2). It weighed about thirty tons, took up about 1800 square feet, and cost
            roughly $500,000 (10 million dollars in today’s terms)! <br>Another very important element of the project was the support of Lieutenant Herman H. Goldstine. He was won over thanks to a paper about the importance of vacuum tubes, a concept
            later used in the ENIAC itself. However, the over-reliance on vacuum tubes became a major flaw in the computer’s design, along with a lack of memory storage, in order to combat this, the team behind the ENIAC used a radar system developed
            by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). This system was able to tell the difference between stationary and moving objects.

        <h3>Beyond ENIAC</h3>
        <p>A predecessor to the ENIAC was called “Annie”. Developed in 1942, Annie had the calculating speed, but lacked this when it came to making a table. Following the ENIAC came the EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) in 1944. Thanks
            to a paper written by John von Neumann, the EDVAC began storing its programs in 1945.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Throughout the forties, lots of innovations were made that heavily influenced computers as we now know them. The question, now, is what we choose to do with them. Computers were first invented as war machines, and they certainly have the potential
            to be devastating. But they also have the power to connect people around the world and speed up research and development. At their core, they are just machines. The question is not one of the morality of a machine, rather one of the morality
            of the user.
